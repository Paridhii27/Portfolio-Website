        <h3>Goal</h3>
        <p>
          Creating a fictional immersive 3D environment that draws parallels
          between human cognitive memory functions (connection,
          compartmentalization, cognition, and consolidation) and computer
          memory structures, exploring how our memories—the accumulation of our
          experiences with places, people, and things—define who we are and
          questioning the blurring boundary between human and digital memories.
        </p>
        <h3>Concept</h3>
        <p>
          Our memories are the accumulation of a lifetime of experience and in
          this sense, our memories are who we are. These memories consist of the
          places, people, and things we interact with in our day-to-day lives.
          “Computerized Memories” is a fictional immersive environment exploring
          the connection between human cognitive memory functions and computer
          memory structures. Human cognitive memory is multifaceted and complex
          consisting of processes such as the storing and retrieval of
          information. There are four main aspects explaining how memory
          functioning occurs in the mind – connection, compartmentalization,
          cognition and consolidation of memories. This project draws parallels
          between memory functioning in humans and computers through a
          speculative lens.
        </p>
        <h3>What does a computer remember?</h3>
        <p>
          It begins with a scene focused on a desk, surrounded by elements that
          evoke a person’s memories in this case my memories. There are pictures
          on the wall that capture the person’s memories from the places they’ve
          visited to the moments they’ve had with their friends and family. The
          desk itself holds personal items like a computer, notes, headphones,
          and other essentials that reflect the person’s daily habits. Each
          object and image is a meaningful connection to the person’s lived
          experiences. The scene is modelled in reference to my own room and
          memories. The scene introduces you to the protagonist of this world.
          The protagonist of the story isn’t the person but it is in fact the
          computer! Sitting on my desk, looking at the photos on my wall one day
          I began thinking how would a computer form its own memories? What
          would the memories of a computer look like? How do human memories get
          translated into digital memories? This project explores these
          questions in many different ways. Delve into the computerized memory
          world to take a look at the inner experiences and memories of a
          computer. Begin by clicking on the computer screen to enter the
          computer’s brain.

          As you enter, you find yourself in a digital landscape where memory
          takes physical form. Cubes float in seemingly random patterns, each
          holding a fragment of experience—this is how a computer remembers
          things in a discrete, modular manner. Unlike human memory, these cubic
          structures stand alone, unnamed and isolated.

          But as you move deeper, something shifts. The second scene reveals
          fractals—intricate, branching patterns that mirror the circuitry of
          RAM. Yet these patterns also echo something profoundly human: the
          synaptic connections between brain cells. Here, the boundary blurs.
          Both computer and human memory rely on connection, on the linking of
          one point to another to form meaning.

          The experience asks you to consider how does a machine remember? When
          you open Spotify, the computer recalls how to process audio. When you
          search on Chrome, it retrieves protocols for accessing the internet.
          When you use the calculator, it performs operations drawn from stored
          functions. But these aren't memories in the way we understand
          them—they're automated responses, triggered by input. A computer
          doesn't reflect on the song it played yesterday or wonder about the
          question you asked last week.

          Human memory, by contrast, is messy and emotional. It consolidates
          over time, transforming experiences into something permanent,
          something that shapes who we are. The final scene brings you to the
          computer's control center—the settings—where traces of your actions
          linger. But are these traces truly memories, or merely logs? The
          computer holds evidence of what happened, but does it remember?
        </p>
        <p>
          The journey explores computerized memory
          structures—compartmentalization through cubic modules, connection
          through fractal patterns, and cognition through application
          interactions—converging on the question of consolidation, the process
          by which memories become permanent, though perhaps in fundamentally
          different ways.

        <h3>Where do our memories end and the computer's begin?</h3>
        <p>
          To fully understand the gravity of this concept, we must also look
          back at where it all began. Initially, there were human
          computers—individuals who carried out the tedious yet essential
          calculations that drove the advancement of technology. During the
          1960s and 1970s, most human computers were replaced by machine
          computers, ushering in the era of automated computing. Fast forward to
          today, and we see computers embedded in nearly every aspect of life.
          This prompts an important question: how do we navigate the
          ever-blurring boundary between what is human and what is computerized?
          As technology becomes indispensable in areas such as navigation,
          healthcare, weather prediction, education, and countless other
          domains, we are left to wonder—are we losing parts of ourselves to the
          computer? Where do our memories end, and where do the computer's
          memories begin? And perhaps most critically, can digital memories ever
          truly replace the cognitive memories that define our humanity?
        </p>
        <p>
          This reflection on the intersection of technology and memory serves as
          a poignant reminder of the profound ways in which computers are
          reshaping our understanding of what it means to remember, to think,
          and ultimately, to be human.
