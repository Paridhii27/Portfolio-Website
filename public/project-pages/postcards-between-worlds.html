        <h3>Concept</h3>
        <p>
          In 2065, environmental collapse has divided humanity. A suffocating
          blanket of toxic smoke covers the earth. Your survival depends on your
          wealth—the poor suffocate in the heat and smog, while the rich escape
          into AI-generated alternate realities, living in fabricated utopias.
        </p>

        <h3>Speculative Future</h3>
        <p>
          Set in 2065, this speculative narrative follows two people who
          exchange postcards across an impossible divide—separated by both
          distance and wealth. One dwells in abundance while the other clings to
          survival.
        </p>
        <p>
          To build their world, we asked: How did they meet? What binds them
          still? Where does utopia end and dystopia begin? These questions
          shaped the contours of their divided existence and the thread of
          longing that connects them

        <h3>Narrative drawn from lived experiences</h3>
        <p>
          At the same time, the story is not entirely speculative or rooted in
          the future. It draws heavily from my own lived experience. Growing up
          in Delhi, India, I witnessed how every October, a thick blanket of
          smog envelops the city, obscuring everything from view. We would get
          days off from school because of the pollution, which has only worsened
          over the years. This ever-present environmental reality serves as a
          stark reminder of our surroundings' fragility and heavily informs the
          narrative's world-building, blending fiction with the lived
          consequences of environmental degradation. The story is also shaped by
          the class differences that divide society. Ultimately, this is a story
          about overcoming these divides—about how people from different
          backgrounds show love through different means.

        <h3>Translating the story into Postcards</h3>
        <p>
          With a clear vision for the story, the next challenge was translating
          it into postcards. How many should there be? What story does the final
          postcard tell? How does the tone evolve? Where are the characters when
          they send each postcard? These questions guided the narrative's shape.
          Each postcard reveals an altered visual scene reflecting the sender's
          environment. There are three postcards from each character, and one
          anonymous postcard at the end—left open for the viewer to interpret.

            These postcards are deeply personal windows into the characters'
            lives and relationship, layered with warmth, love, and conflict.
            Through each one, they share fragments of their world. Despite the
            physical and societal barriers separating them, the warmth in their
            messages reflects their profound connection. Yet their differing
            circumstances create tension—they cannot be together. The contrast
            between privilege and relentless struggle runs beneath every
            exchange. The person in utopia is willing to give up everything to
            fight for their love. The person in dystopia is growing flowers for
            the other, even as their world deteriorates.
          </p>

          <h3>Visual Environments</h3>
          <p>
            All environments are modeled in Unreal Engine. TouchDesigner visual
            effects and color grading create a transition from utopia to
            dystopia. The project is compiled as an archive book, with postcards
            interspersed among pressed flowers, leaves, images, and digital
            artifacts. Both characters try to see the world through the other's
            eyes to find each other. One sends dreamy images, while the other
            reveals the harsh reality of their world.
