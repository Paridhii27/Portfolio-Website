        <h3>Concept</h3>
        <p>
          It's the year 2065, and the world's environment has deteriorated to a
          critical point. A suffocating blanket of smoke covers the land,
          choking life itself. Your fate depends entirely on your status in
          society—either you're left to perish in the oppressive smoke and heat,
          or you gain access to the revolutionary AI technology that creates an
          alternate reality for you, allowing you to live in a fabricated
          utopia.
        </p>

        <h3>Speculative Future</h3>
        <p>
          In such times, two people exchange postcards because they cannot see
          each other in person due to their vastly different income brackets.
          The inherent systemic inequalities of society have created physical
          barriers that keep them apart. One comes from a wealthy family, while
          the other struggles to survive with barely enough to stay alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Building on this narrative of a speculative future, we began to
          develop the world these characters inhabit, exploring questions like:
          How do the characters know each other? How long have they been
          connected? What is the central conflict, if any? Where does each
          character live? What makes one place a utopia and the other a
          dystopia? These questions guide us in shaping the nuances of their
          lives and the divided world they navigate.
        </p>

        <h3>Narrative drawn from lived experiences</h3>
        <p>
          At the same time the story is not entirely speculative. It also draws
          heavily from our own personal lived experiences. Having grown up in
          Delhi, India, I have spent my entire life witnessing how, as soon as
          October arrives, a thick blanket of smog envelops the city, obscuring
          everything from view. We would often get days off from school because
          of the pollution and the air pollution has gotten worse with the
          years. This ever-present environmental reality serves as a stark
          reminder of the fragility of our surroundings and heavily informs the
          world-building in the narrative, blending fiction with the lived
          consequences of environmental degradation. It is also informed by the
          class differences present in society and how it tends to divide
          people. This is a story about overcoming these divides and how people
          from different backgrounds show love through different means.
        </p>

        <h3>Translating the story into Postcards</h3>
        <p>
          Once we had a clear vision for the story, the next challenge was
          figuring out how to translate it into the format of postcards. How
          many postcards should there be? What story does the final postcard
          tell? How does the tone evolve over time? Where are the characters
          located when they send each postcard? These questions guided the
          process of shaping the narrative through this unique medium. Each
          postcard exchange reveals an altered visual scene reflecting the
          environment the characters inhabited. There are three postcards each
          from both of the characters and one anonymous postcard at the end
          which the viewer can interpret as being sent by either one of them.

            These postcards are not just exchanges of words; they are deeply
            personal windows into the characters' lives and their relationship,
            layered with warmth, love, and conflict. Through each postcard, the
            characters share fragments of their world—offering glimpses of their
            lives. Despite the physical and societal barriers that separate
            them, the warmth in their messages reflects the profound connection
            they share. At the same time, their differing circumstances
            inevitably give rise to tensions as they’re not able to be there
            with each other. The contrast between their lives—the privilege of
            one and the relentless struggles of the other—creates an
            undercurrent of conflict. The person in utopia willing to give up
            everything to fight for their love and the person in dystopia
            growing flowers for the other even in the deteriorating conditions.
          </p>

          <h3>3D Environments</h3>
          <p>
            The 3D environments these characters inhabit are all modelled in
            Unreal Engine. The visual effects reflect a transition from a
            utopian to a dystopic existence through colour grading and
            TouchDesigner effects. Lastly, the project is compiled as an archive
            book with the postcards interspersed with pressed flowers, leaves,
            images and an artifact. Both the characters are trying to see the
            world as the other in order to find each other. All the images sent
            by one are dreamy while the other shows the harsh reality of the
            world.
          </p>
