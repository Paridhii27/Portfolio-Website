        <h3>Concept</h3>
        <p>
          "Firefly Symphony" is a multimedia series created for the "Treading
          lightly in a world of many worlds" class taught by Anthony Dunne and
          Fiona Raby. Drawing on Jakob von Uexküll's concept of the Umwelt—how
          living beings perceive their environments. This project enters the
          unique sensory orbit of a firefly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fireflies are terrestrial organisms that communicate through
          bioluminescence. "Firefly Symphony" is a fictional festival
          celebrating how fireflies interact with environmental cues,
          communicate through light and chemical signals, and experience an
          altered sense of time.

        <h3>Orbit of a Firefly</h3>
        <p>
          As I hover through the meadow, my abdomen pulses with a rhythmic glow.
          Flash! Flash! Flash! I send light signals to my distant sparkle of
          fireflies. Wings beating steadily, I move toward the answering glow
          that seems to play tricks with me—receding as I approach, then
          suddenly appearing before me. Light bends, warps and sticks. My
          antennae read sensory cues, helping me navigate the field—a liminal
          space with pockets of moisture blending with warm clusters of air. The
          ground sends vibrations through my delicate wings, mapping my
          ephemeral surroundings. Beneath me, the dark long shards of grass
          stretch endlessly.

        <h3>Invitation to the Firefly Symphony</h3>
        <p>
          You're cordially invited to witness the ephemeral light dance of
          fireflies where flashes and screeches of light weave conversations
          between the land and the sky. The air is pulsing with a luminous
          rhythm and fascination tugs you along. There are fireflies lurking
          just above the grass and soaring in the sky. Lay down on the picnic
          blanket and sense the luminous pulses of light and see the sky's
          topology transform in front of you. It's the most beautiful time of
          the year and the weather is optimal outside with winds drifting at the
          speed of 13-15 kph and high moisture content in the air around. The
          groundward fireflies are sending signals of celebration and gratitude
          while the skyward fireflies send signals to avoid the predators. It's
          a balancing dance to celebrate their day-to-day lives. A festival that
          strongly encourages you to silently listen to the world through your
          eyes.

        <h3>At the Festival</h3>
        <p>
          Getting off the train, I hear a voice say "Welcome to the Firefly
          Symphony. The festival begins in five minutes as the sun begins its
          descent into the horizon. The weather's optimal outside, the sky a
          liminal space with pockets of moisture and the air pulsing with a
          luminous glow. Head over to the meadow with your firefly connectors."
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon my firefly connector activates, pulsing rhythmically, the
          sensation tugging me northward. I walk through the meadow – light
          bends, warps and sticks along firefly flight paths, transforming the
          space around me. Walking a mile, I become increasingly attuned to my
          surroundings. As I get closer to the fireflies, my connector dims to
          darkness which is a signal to let go. I slow my breathing and body's
          rhythm, becoming one with the ground and sky. Lying in the grass, I'm
          surrounded by the natural ephemeral glow of fireflies dancing through
          the air.
