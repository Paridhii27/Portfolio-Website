        <h3>Concept</h3>
        <p>
          According to research published on the National Library of Medicine
          portal under the title of "The Temperature of emotions", there is a
          close correlation between emotions and temperature through embodied
          processes. We can see evidence of this in the way we tend to describe
          emotions through the language of temperature. Feeling warm or
          heartwarming is often associated with happiness and the feeling of
          being content. Being cold with someone or chilled with fear on the
          other hand often has negative connotations. Emotional temperature is
          implicitly and explicitly seen in many aspects of our life. This
          research went into the subtleties of these findings to understand how
          emotions and temperature are related cognitively. The research on this
          concept is still scarce but they found out that the region of
          hypothalamus in our brain which is responsible for maintaining the
          body's internal balance does so by regulating temperature, through a
          process of homeostasis. Emotions are homeostasis responses to maintain
          our body's internal balance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, "the theory of constructed emotions suggests that
          emotions are categorizations of past experiences molded by embodied
          knowledge. Emotions do not come from specific brain structures, rather
          the brain creates them as concepts by parsing sensory information,
          affect and physiological changes." The brain triggers these responses
          depending on the way different sensory inputs and physiological
          processes are interpreted which is closely tied to the process of
          homeostasis.
        </p>
        <h3>Temperature Visualizer</h3>
        <p>
          For my project I created a temperature change visualizer using
          physical computing. There is a DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensor
          attached to a 8x8 dot matrix. I wanted the device to be able to sense
          a change in temperature when a person holds the sensor in their hand.
          The device simultaneously shows a color visualization of the measured
          temperature. The temperature is reflective of the heat index
          (saturation and hue) of the colour and the humidity gives us the alpha
          or blur of the colours. This was a project built to visualize the
          concept of the temperature of emotions. Colours are a means of
          reflecting these emotions in the device.
        </p>
        <h3>Fabrication</h3>
        <p>
          The 8x8 dot matrix is embedded in a laser cut acrylic box with a slot
          for the DHT11 temperature sensor to be attached to.

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          This project came with a lot of challenges in terms of the
          compatibility of the DHT11 temperature sensor with the LED matrix. I
          studied many different temperature sensors and got a sense of how they
          worked by the end of it. The DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensor
          features a temperature and humidity sensor complex with a calibrated
          digital signal output.
