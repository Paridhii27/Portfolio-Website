        <h3>Design Problem</h3>
        <p>
          How to create an interactive art experience that visualizes quantum
          states in real-time at the intersection of quantum physics and art.
        </p>
        <h3>Concept</h3>
        <p>
          Move a Bit is a live motion capture project showcasing quantum
          entanglement and the messiness of quantum noise. Quantum entanglement
          suggests that there is a special correlation between qubits and
          quantum systems. Just as there is a special correlation between
          qubits, the particles in Move-a-Bit have a special correlation with
          the subject in motion. Movement produces the quantum state with all
          the quantum possibilities represented in different colors. Stillness
          represents the observed collapsed, classical state. Essentially a
          system which is entangled with you and exists only when you move.
        </p>
        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>
          This was the first time I was learning about quantum computing and the
          concept felt intimidating at first so making it more approachable was
          a key goal of this project. As a group we wanted to create something
          that helped one understand and explore the quantum concept of
          entanglement in a simple, fun and engaging manner. Taking this project
          to gallery spaces in New York and seeing how people interacted with it
          was also really exciting.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the working of the project, it uses a live camera feed going
          into TouchDesigner, and data generated using IBM's Qiskit platform to
          create a live motion capture project that brings quantum entanglement
          to life. To generate the quantum data to guide the properties of our
          motion-reactive particles, we used the quantum concept of W-state to
          entangle three qubits.

        <p>
          The three qubit value shots were then used to control the RGB color
          values of the particles. These particles are generated using particle
          systems in TouchDesigner which is a node-based programming language
          used for creating such interactive visuals. The particles that aren't
          of the original R G B colors (red: (1,0,0), green:(0,1,0), blue:
          (0,0,1)) are a demonstration of noise, or quantum computation errors.

        <h3>Gallery Experience</h3>
        <p>
          Further, after setting up the live camera feed we also set up a
          projector to display “move a bit” on a large wall to capture all body
          movements which eventually generated the particles.
